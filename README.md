  I am currently learning Computer Science and Cybersecurity. Studying both is hard since focusing on one is so much easier. I love Linux; it is one of the best types of OS that is open-source and free. I might plan to do some projects in the future. My goal right now is to learn. I am also into privacy, also why I don't have a lot of social media.

âš¡ Fun fact about me:
  - I am a supporter of Edward Snowden. I believe the Internet should be free and private.
  - I disagree with surveillance, not that I have something to hide but that privacy should be a right for everyone.
